Starting with the version 5.0.0, the Franca fidl files in the folder franca/api define 
the official GENIVI interface of the EnhancedPositionService component

The interface defined in the XML files in the folder dbus/api may diverge 
from the offical API defined in the fidl files.
This is a well-known problem that will be solved in future releases.
