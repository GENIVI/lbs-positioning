Positioning - Release Notes
=========================================

Introduction
------------
The master branch is a development branch.
The head revision is not guaranteed to be stable.
Stable versions are marked using git tags.
 
The positioning repository contains the standardized APIs and the proof of concept of three GENIVI components: 
the GNSSService, the SensorsService and the EnhancedPositionService.

Prefixes have been used to distinguish tags referring to different components:
 GNSS -> GNSSService
 SNS -> SensorsService
 ENPOS -> EnhancedPositionService

The versions used in the tags must always match the versions of the GENIVI components specifications contained in the folder 'doc'.
Example: 
The tag ENPOS-3.0.0 identifies a stable version of the EnhancedPositionService that contains the document
GENIVI_EnhancedPositionService_ComponentSpecification.pdf version 3.0.0.
