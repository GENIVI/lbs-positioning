Positioning PoC
============================
The Positioning PoC is a collection of 4 proofs of concept:
* GNSSService
* SensorsService
* EnhancedPositionService
* LogReplayer

===============================
How To Build
===============================

To build the positioning proofs of concept please follow the following steps:

./build-all.sh 

or

./build-all.sh [command] [service]

command:
  make            Build
  install         Install
  clean           Clean
  help            Print Help

service:
  gnss            Test GNSSService
  sns             Test SensorsService
  enhpos          Test EnhancedPositionService
  repl            Test Replayer


===============================
How To Test
===============================

./run-test.sh [service]

service:
  gnss            Test GNSSService
  sns             Test SensorsService
  enhpos          Test EnhancedPositionService
  repl            Test Replayer
  help            Print Help


===============================
Compiler Options
===============================

If you wish to change the default cmake-options, please open
the file build-all.sh, edit the compiler flags, delete the build directory
and recompile the code from scratch.

---------
Example
---------

If you wish to activate DLT logging for the GNSSService, just change the  
value of GNSS_SERVICE_FLAGS in the file build-all.sh as follows:
GNSS_SERVICE_FLAGS='-DWITH_DLT=ON'

---------
Notes
---------

DWITH_GPSD=ON requires that the package 'gpsd' is installed.
To install 'gpsd', please execute the following commands:
sudo apt-get install gpsd
sudo apt-get install libgps-dev

To test the enhanced-positon-service the package Qt4 must be installed.
To install Qt4, please execute the following command:
sudo apt-get install qtcreator

DWITH_TESTS=ON enables the compilation of the test application(s).

DWITH_DLT=ON requires that the DLT-daemon is installed.
To download the DLT-daemon, just execute the following command:
git clone git://git.projects.genivi.org/dlt-daemon.git
To install the DLT-daemon, etxract the tarball and follow the 
instructions in the file install.txt.

DWITH_IPHONE=ON requires that the iPhone app SensorLogger is
installed on a iPhone and that the option to broadcast the
sensor data is activated (port=5555).
